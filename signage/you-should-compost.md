# 40 Clarkson Composts

Did you know you can compost food waste at 40 Clarkson Avenue? You can! And you should!

We use the finished compost to keep our street trees healthy, so they'll grow into a grand and magestic canopy. And we use it in our own courtyards, where we recently planted a pear tree, a fig tree and a dogwood. 

This year we got a grant from [Citizens Committee for NYC](http://www.citizensnyc.org/grants/composting-grant) to buy new bins and get more households in our building composting.

## So ... what can you compost?

*Yes*:
Vegetable scraps, egg shells, coffee grounds, orange peels, leftovers, stale bread. 

*No*: meat, fish, cheese, pet waste or oil. 
  
## How do I get there?

You can either enter the courtyard through the laundry room -- take a left and you'll find it -- or from the A-G line recycling bins, exit past the bins and take a right. 

We've made a lot of progress cleaning up the courtyards so check them out even if you aren't ready to compost!

## Get Involved
We could really use help creating better signs to help everyone find the compost bins. 

And if you want to know more about composting, [Brooklyn Botanic Garden](http://www.bbg.org/gardening/composting) is a great resource!
