Neighbors,

As some of you know, the building got a small citizens committee grant
to clean up our compost system and expand it. We promised Citizens
Committee that we could get at least a dozen households at 40 Clarkson
composting, so we need your help!

We have one new compost bin set up, and another one on the way, and we
have a new compost crank that will help us aerate our compost. We've
been working on building up the soil in the area around the compost bins
and finding plants that will thrive in the shade there -- a few new
ferns and vines are doing quite well.

We'd love to see more households composting. If you want a walk through
of the system, let me know -- I'm in *redacted*, or you can email me. Or, just
bring your compost down. Look for a bin that doesn't have an "I'm
resting" sign on it and dump your scraps in. Give the bin a spin. If
there are leaves, add a fistful.

Do compost...
* Vegetable trimmings
* Rotten produce
* Potting soil and healthy plants
* Coffee grounds
* Egg shells
* Corncobs
* Napkins and papertowels
* Bread
* Cardboard egg cartons

Please don't compost...
* Meat or fish scraps
* Cheese or dairy products
* Kitty litter
* Cat or dog poop (or any poop. No poop.)
* Charcoal
* Invasive weeds
* Diseased plants

And if you want a reminder to post to your fridge, here's a well
formatted sign from the city of New York:

Not only will you help reduce the amount of garbage that 40 Clarkson
sends to the landfill, you'll help make our block more beautiful. We use
finished compost to mulch the street trees and to improve the soil in
our courtyards.

Thanks!
Amanda
