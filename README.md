Compost on Clarkson
================

We got a Citizens Committe grant to expand our compost system and document it. This is that documentation. 

## Funds

[Citizens Committee for New York](http://www.citizensnyc.org/grants/composting-grant) gives out grants to support community composting. 

## Supplies

The Brooklyn Botanic Garden maintains a [nice supply list](http://www.bbg.org/gardening/article/compost_a_guide_to_equipment). Here's what we've got:

+ 2 [80 Gallon Compost Tumblers](http://www.buylifetime.com/products/blt/pid-60060.aspx): $190/ea
+ 1 [compost crank](): $42 from the [NYC compost outreach program](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/compost/edu_equip_order.shtml#crank) 

## Review

I like the Lifetime Tumblers because they're big, sturdy, they sit up off the ground (away from the rats ... it is New York City). Two complaints: there's no brakes on the lid, so unless it is up against a tree or wall, the lid falls all the way open which turns out to be pretty unmanageable. Second, there's no handle on the lid. Minor annoyances, but annoying nonetheless. 

Note: if you compost in your apartment building, I'd love to know what kind of bin you use. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/amandabee/compost-clarkson/issues) to tell me about your bin.

## Reading

Sweet Home has a [great roundup](http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-composters/) of compost bin reviews. They don't talk about either of the bins we have, but that shouldn't stop you from checking out their findings.
