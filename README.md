Compost on Clarkson
================

We got a Citizens Committe grant to expand our compost system and document it. This is that documentation. 

## Funds

[Citizens Committee for New York](http://www.citizensnyc.org/grants/composting-grant) gives out grants to support community composting. 

## Supplies

The Brooklyn Botanic Garden maintains a [nice supply list](http://www.bbg.org/gardening/article/compost_a_guide_to_equipment). Here's what we've got:

+ 2 [80 Gallon Compost Tumblers](http://www.buylifetime.com/products/blt/pid-60060.aspx): $190/ea
+ 1 [compost crank](): $42 from the [NYC compost outreach program](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/compost/edu_equip_order.shtml#crank)
